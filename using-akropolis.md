# ðŸ§  Using Akropolis

### Connect your wallet

First, **Connect your wallet** using the button at the top right corner.&#x20;

We support multiple types of wallets (the most popular choice is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)). Make sure that your wallet is connected to the right network (Ethereum mainnet).

### Deposit <a href="#if-you-already-have-the-required-token-for-the-vault-that-you-would-like-to-deposit-in" id="if-you-already-have-the-required-token-for-the-vault-that-you-would-like-to-deposit-in"></a>

* Select the vault that you would like to deposit into.
* Enter the amount of tokens you want to deposit into the vault.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure you have enough ETH/BNB/native network token to pay for transaction fees.
{% endhint %}

* Click on 'Approve' or 'Deposit' button. _Depending on previous approvals given, you might need to confirm 2 transactions (approval for spending & deposit)._
* Confirm the transaction in your wallet (you should see a popup). Transaction confirmation time depends on the gas fee & network congestion (usually it's as fast as 1-3 minutes).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can speed it up by [paying a higher gas fee to the network](https://blog.leverj.io/how-to-set-the-gas-limit-and-gas-price-in-metamask-1b33c38c32fd). If your transaction gets stuck, see [this guide](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251-How-to-Speed-Up-or-Cancel-a-Pending-Transaction) on speeding up or cancelling the transaction.
{% endhint %}

* When your transaction succeeds, you will see your deposited balance in the interface.&#x20;

* Enter how much you want to withdraw, or click 'Max" to withdraw the entire balance.

* Click 'Withdraw'.
* You will see a confirmation popup from your wallet. Click 'Confirm'.&#x20;
* You will receive tokens in your wallet when your transaction succeeds.

### What do I do if I don't have funds on the Vault's network? <a href="#if-you-dont-have-the-required-token-for-the-vault-that-you-would-like-to-deposit-in" id="if-you-dont-have-the-required-token-for-the-vault-that-you-would-like-to-deposit-in"></a>

This is quite common as sending funds across chains can be a stressful experience both in terms of security and user experience.&#x20;

Bridging assets cross-chain is important, however, as you cannot initiate transactions without the chain's native asset to pay for gas fees.

### Arbitrum

### â€‹Binance Smart chain <a href="#tools-to-track-your-funds" id="tools-to-track-your-funds"></a>

Binance Smart chain uses BNB (BEP-20 format) as its native asset for transaction fees.

To transfer assets cross-chain, you can use BSC bridge:
