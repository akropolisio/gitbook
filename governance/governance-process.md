# üìã Governance process

### **High-Level Summary**

* Initial Governance will be done through the [Akropolis Snapshot.page](https://snapshot.org/#/akropolis.eth);
* Active AKRO stakers will be able to post proposals and vote on them.

### **What can I signal my vote on?**

* Product features and integrations
* Product fees
* Strategy proposals

### **How do I vote?**

* Go to the [Akropolis space](https://snapshot.org/#/akropolis.eth) on Snapshot;
* Click on ‚ÄúConnect wallet‚Äù button in top right corner;
* Connect to the wallet which you use for staking of AKRO ;
* Click on the option you want to vote for;
* Sign the message via your wallet and done.
* Voting will be open for 3 days or 72 hours, so if it opens on Wed 1300CET, it will close on Friday 1300CET (approximately, as closing time is set by the block number).

### **Governance Workflow:**

* All proposals should first be discussed over the [governance forum](https://gov.akropolis.io/) and in Discord. That would give all governance participants an ability to understand all pros & cons before voting.
* The team will assign time values (i.e. urgent vs non-urgent, pending, etc) to titles based on our discretion.
* For feature requests please name your proposal AFR+n (i.e. third proposal is named AFR-003).
* For governance proposals AIP+n (i.e. third proposal is named AIP-003).
* After the initial discussion is completed & community (including team) agree that it should be officially voted on ‚Äî team or community members can post it on Snapshot page for voting. And as it‚Äôs off-chain voting, it does not require any gas fees.
* After voting is completed & proposal reaches 10% quorum (of staked AKRO), we will add it to our development pipeline.

{% hint style="info" %}
If quorum is not reached, the proposal might be resubmitted for voting after 7 days cooldown.
{% endhint %}

### **Who can create or vote on proposals?**

* Only individual AKRO stakers can create or vote for proposals.  We cannot verify how users staking $AKRO via centralised exchanges would vote on a proposal, so they are excluded from voting. This ensures that only individual stakers using Akropolis platform can participate in the governance process.
* 1 vote equals 1 AKRO staked.
* There is a minimum of 25M AKRO to create a proposal on Snapshot.
* There is no minimum for voting.

Please check Snapshot docs for more information about [creating proposals ](https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/create-a-proposal)& [voting on proposals](https://docs.snapshot.page/guides/vote-for-a-proposal).
