# Funding Rate Monitoring

To function correctly, the **Funding Rate** must be favorable to Vortex. If the Funding Rate is consistently against Vortex, positions will be managed/unwound accordingly. This funding rate is constantly managed by the Vortex Manager and, if is determined that the funding rate will remain unfavourable for a prolonged amount of time, then the strategy will be unwound to prevent further losses.
