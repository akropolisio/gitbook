### What is C2FC <a href="#what-is-c2fc" id="what-is-c2fc"></a>

The C2FC is a digital token, which acts as automatically executed right to claim a defined part of the future cashflow that arrives at issuer Ethereum address within a given time frame.

C2FC is materially different to the current implementations of ERC948 (EIP 1337) and EIP1620. The improvement is in the following features:

* Direct debit initialisation by the sender
* Ability to realize escrow logic for payments receiver
* Ability to transfer ownership to receive recurring payments: transferred to another person
* Tokens are composable and can be grouped into a portfolio according to pre-defined characteristics

### What are the benefits <a href="#what-are-the-benefits" id="what-are-the-benefits"></a>

C2FC issuance allows to present future cashflows of any business or individual in as a single token, that can be easily exchanged, traded or used as collateral, thus materially simplifying workflows and opening up a potential for new DeFi instruments and interactions.

You can attract additional liquidity without using a 150% ensuring in digital assets by trading C2FC.

### How does it work <a href="#how-does-it-work" id="how-does-it-work"></a>

An already operating business or an individual who has regular income payments, that needs additional liquidity at the moment can issue C2FC for defined future periods and trade them at marketplace. It looks like exchanging future cashflows for "money now" by selling discounted C2FC or borrowing funds, using C2FC as collateral.

### Are there any risks involved in issuing or trading C2FCs? <a href="#are-there-any-risks-involved-in-issuing-or-trading-c2fcs" id="are-there-any-risks-involved-in-issuing-or-trading-c2fcs"></a>

C2FC issuance itself does not provide any risks until it is involved in the open market. When it is exchanged to other unit of value and changed ownership, there is a risk that future cashflow would be lower than estimated or there would no money arrived at all. This issue primarily is connected with the correct risk assessment of the C2FC issuer.

Considering the transparency of the C2FC itself and related indicators, the risk assessment would be no harder and in some cases can even be more reliable than in centralized finance.
