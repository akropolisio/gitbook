# AkropolisOS

AkropolisOS is A Solidity framework for building complex dApps and protocols (savings, pensions, loans, investments).

AkropolisOS is a framework for creating and managing distributed digital financial organisations. Anybody can use AkropolisOS to set up and collectively manage distributed capital pools with customisable user incentives, automated liquidity provision enabled by the bonding curve mechanism, and programmatic liquidity and treasury management. Designed as an upgradeable modular framework based on OpenZeppelin, AkropolisOS provides lego-like scalability without the loss of coherence and security.

[Sparta](sparta.md) is an undercollaterized credit pool based on AkropolisOS, where members of which can earn high-interest rates by providing undercollateralized loans to other members and by pooling and investing capital through various liquid DeFi instruments.

[Delphi](delphi.md) is a yield farming aggregator with dollar cost averaging tooling. Delphi allows users to gain yield on synthetic savings, farm tokens from integrated protocols/pools, and invest in volatile assets using an active “all in” approach or a passive dollar cost averaging strategy.
