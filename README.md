# ðŸ•¶ Introduction

Akropolis was founded in 2017 based on a vision of an alternative financial system, based on non-USD-denominated, real-world assets (RWA)-based stablecoins and DAOs performing the roles equivalent to those of the pension funds, community banks and credit unions of today.&#x20;

Since 2022, Akropolis has [transitioned](https://medium.com/akropolis/akropolis-kickoff-2022-c7427c7be302) to a DAO, and has been operated by the contributors, some of whom are long-standing community members. Its key highlights to date have been:

* The first guarded launch in DeFi;&#x20;
* All-time high total value locked (TVL) of US$25mn;&#x20;
* Being part of the [IDEO Colab DeFi Incubator & Residency Programme. ](https://medium.com/ideo-colab/ideo-colab-launches-collaborative-defi-incubator-residency-program-a32ddd6e9f36)

AkropolisDAO continues to be operated by its contributors.

Our current products include:

* **yVaults** - Streamlined and simplified access to select [Yearn](https://yearn.fi/) vaults to optimize yields.
* **Liquity** **integration -** acting as a frontend provider for [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) troves and staking.

We believe Akropolis is the one-stop solution for any investor seeking access to passive, efficient and sustainable yield generation.
