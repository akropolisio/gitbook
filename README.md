# ðŸ•¶ Introduction

Akropolisâ€™ mission is to give everyone the tools to save, grow and provision for the future safely and without dependence on a central counterparty, or to fall prey to predatory financial practices of multiple intermediaries.&#x20;

Our goal is to create yield-generating products that donâ€™t predominantly rely on inflationary emissions as the main source of yield and that generate returns regardless of the market conditions.

Our current products include:

* **Vortex** - An on-chain basis trading strategy that aims to generate long-term, sustainable and rewarding yields while remaining market-neutral.
* **yVaults** - Streamlined and simplified access to select Yearn vaults to optimize yields.

We believe Akropolis is the one-stop solution for any investor seeking access to passive, efficient and sustainable yield generation.
