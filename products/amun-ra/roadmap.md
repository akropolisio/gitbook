# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

**v1 - Amun Ra on Mainnet**

Amun Ra will launch with basic AMM functionality, including asset swaps and liquidity provision.

**v2 - Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool**

Amun Ra will be a platform for other StarkNet-native tokens to launch on the network efficiently and seamlessly establish liquidity.

**v2 - Established TWAP Oracle**

Through high token liquidity, Amun Ra can become the go-to TWAP for StarkNet.

**v2 - Fee Tiers**

Introduction of "fee tiers" to incentivize increased volume for common "base" pairs and increased liquidity for "exotic" long-tail pairs.

**v3 - New Invariant**

Integrate a new invariant into the AMM (details TBA), enabling higher capital efficiency and superior pricing.

**v3 - Factory Pools**

Allow the creation of factory pools and fully permissionless markets on Amun Ra.

**v4 - Advanced Oracle Calls**

Amun Ra will be able to optimally utilize oracles, bringing benefits such as more efficient pricing and a significantly improved user experience.
