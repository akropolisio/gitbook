# ðŸ’œ AKRO staking

Currently, stake tab has only one pool - AKRO staking. It's a simple staking pool with easy mechanics - by sending AKRO to this pool you can earn AKRO itself. There is no lock-ups, you can withdraw any time.&#x20;

### How to stake? <a href="#how-to-stake" id="how-to-stake"></a>

* Open Akropolis app & connect your wallet (_don't forget to check that you have AKRO on it!_)
* Go to [staking page](https://akropolis.io/staking)
* Enter the amount of tokens you want to deposit & or click max to deposit all AKRO you have on your wallet.&#x20;
* Click on 'Approve' or 'Deposit' button. _Depending on previous approvals given, you might need to confirm 2 transactions (approval for spending & deposit)._
* Confirm the transaction in your wallet (you should see a popup). Transaction confirmation time depends on the gas fee & network congestion (usually it's as fast as 1-3 minutes).
* When your transaction succeeds, you will see your deposited balance in the interface.&#x20;

You can speed it up by [paying a higher gas fee to the network](https://blog.leverj.io/how-to-set-the-gas-limit-and-gas-price-in-metamask-1b33c38c32fd). If your transaction gets stuck, see [this guide](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489251-How-to-Speed-Up-or-Cancel-a-Pending-Transaction) on speeding up or cancelling the transaction.
